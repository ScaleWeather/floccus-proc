Procedural macros for floccus

This crate contains procedural attribute macros (currently only one) used by the
[floccus](https://crates.io/crates/floccus). But potentially can be used in some
other crates, although will never be adapted to work with any other crate.

Source code of this crate is a heavily modified copy of [log-derive](https://crates.io/crates/log-derive).
Check that crate for more versatile logging procedural macros.
